## Minutes Of Meeting

- date: 2019.09.18.

### summary

#### DIFS (Data Infra File System)

- Introduce DIFS
  - using repo-ng command (just command)
  - segments stored file storage
  - rename segments: file storage (ex: /{file_storage_routable_name}/{contentname})
  - rename segments information is provided as a manifest file through Key/Value storage
  - manifest distributed through Key/Value storage
- GOAL
  - object storage in an NDN environment
  - DIFS = file storage + Key/Value storage

##### DIFS file storage

- Environment
  - basically, repo-ng environment
  - replace the sqlite3 with a file storage
- unstructured data storage
  - stored of a segment in the form of a blob
- How  configure the optimal directory

##### DIFS Key/Value storage

- DIFS clustering
  - each DIFS has its own hash range configuration
- Key/Value storage select
  - hash range comparison that is responsible for the hash of the content name
- Key-Value store
  - Key: content_name hashing result
  - Value: manifest file

#### Performance Test Comparison (repo-ng VS DIFS)

- compare DIFS/repo-ng performance
  - test case is required for an itemized performance indicator

### NEXT ITEM

- schedule
- detailed mechanism
  - directory configuration is important
  - make the necessary interest commands
  - file storage and Key/Value storage characteristics and advantages are important
- various test cases are required for performance comparison
